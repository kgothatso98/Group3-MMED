Modeling the 1918 Spanish Flu in South Africa This repository presents a work-in-progress project exploring the dynamics of the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic in South Africa using stochastic epidemiological models. It focuses on estimating the basic reproduction number (Râ‚€), accounting for latent infection periods, natural and disease-related mortality, and fitting compartmental models to historical outbreak data. Materials will include code, datasets, and documentation to support research into epidemic heterogeneity and disease dynamics in the South African context.
